## Background

Credit scoring is a vital tool for assessing an individual's creditworthiness. Traditional credit scoring methods often rely on fixed rules and manual judgments, which can lead to inaccuracies and biases. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can automatically learn scoring patterns from large datasets, improving the accuracy and fairness of the scoring process.
