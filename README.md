# Credit Scoring Based on Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a credit scoring model using machine learning techniques to assess the credit risk of individuals or businesses. By analyzing historical credit data, the model can provide more accurate credit scores, helping financial institutions make informed lending decisions.

## Background

Credit scoring is a vital tool for assessing an individual's creditworthiness. Traditional credit scoring methods often rely on fixed rules and manual judgments, which can lead to inaccuracies and biases. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can automatically learn scoring patterns from large datasets, improving the accuracy and fairness of the scoring process.

## Dataset

- [Dataset Name]: The Home Equity dataset (HMEQ)
- [Dataset Source]: [Provide link or description](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ajay1735/hmeq-data/data)
- [Dataset content]: The Home Equity dataset (HMEQ) contains baseline and loan performance information for 5,960 recent home equity loans. The target (BAD) is a binary variable indicating whether an applicant eventually defaulted or was seriously delinquent. This adverse outcome occurred in 1,189 cases (20%). For each applicant, 12 input variables were recorded.
